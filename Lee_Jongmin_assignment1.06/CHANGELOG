Assignment Progress Log

Date: 09/14/23

Initial progress began with importing Professor's code from version 1.01.
I made adjustments to certain map generation functions to gain better control over the placement of exits.
The 'world' structure was introduced.
A user input loop was added, laying the groundwork for interactive gameplay.
Implemented functionality for character teleportation and movement.
Incorporated edge detection to seal off exits.
Introduced a probability factor for the spawning of Pokemarts and Pokecenters.

Homework 1.03

Date: 09/20/23

Leveraging the codebase from version 1.02, I refactored the main program to focus on printing a single map.
Implemented Dijkstra's algorithm for the 'hiker' character.
Dedicated time to debug and resolve issues with the 'hiker' character.
Added a print function to display the 'hiker' map.
Extended Dijkstra's algorithm for the 'rivals' characters.
Debugged issues related to Dijkstra's for 'rivals'.
Discovered a recurring problem affecting approximately 15% of program runs.
Expanded printing functionality to include the 'rivals' map.
Developed the computation for both 'hiker' and 'rival' characters in the main program.
Enhanced the main program by displaying all three maps.

Homework 1.04

Date: 10/01/23

Building on Professor's code from version 1.03, I focused on streamlining the movement-related elements between maps.
Established the foundational structure for in-game items, including a 'Trainer' structure and a 'Trainer' map within the global 'world'.
Introduced various helper functions to facilitate character movement.
Implemented a rudimentary character movement system, albeit with some issues and a lack of previous character deletion.
Acknowledged the presence of several bugs that require further attention but succeeded in achieving basic character movement.

Refined the functions responsible for determining the next logical step for characters.
Dedicated extensive debugging efforts to resolve issues that previously resulted in trailing characters.
Overhauled the character structure by introducing the 'cost' variable, a 'direction,' and a 'type' variable.
Added a display control variable, contributing to a smoother gameplay experience.
Invested considerable effort in debugging and fine-tuning various elements.
Revamped the logic governing character interactions with walls, implementing error detection on all sides during movement.
Despite significant progress, a perplexing issue persists: when a character moves away and subsequently returns to its original position, it becomes stuck, preventing further movement. Debugging efforts have been inconclusive, leaving me in a state of frustration and puzzlement.

Homework 1.05

Date: 10/11/23

Transitioned from version 1.04 of Professor's code.
Incorporated the 'ncurses' library for enhanced text-based UI.
Updated the map printing functionality to utilize 'ncurses.'
Introduced basic input handling for user interaction.
Developed function prototypes for displaying various in-game elements.
Initiated work on player character (PC) movement, although it remains somewhat flawed.

Further expanded on PC movement, ensuring that distance maps update correctly as the PC moves.
Implemented collision detection for Pokemarts and Pokecenters.
Enabled users to "enter" battles, marts, and centers.
Implemented functionality to erase defeated enemies post-battle.
Introduced a menu for trainers, making it easier for users to track their progress.
Recognized the absence of inter-map movement capabilities. Unfortunately, characters cannot transition between maps at this stage.
The only notable issue, which is more of a limitation, is the inability to move between maps directly.
