Poke327.c

I decided to work on professor's code insetead working on my code since my code was messy.
I added initializeUniverse, randGen, possibility, noExit, new_map, place_pokemart, place_pokecenter(both mart and center 
added possibility of spawn), and main function mostly. I worked whole day to find where bug is happening and found it 
but don't know what should I do next and it's time to submit my work. This is really frustrating. If you find what's causing
segmentation fault bug please let me know and tell me how can I fix it will be appriciated.

Data Structures:

      path_t: A structure representing a path on the map.
      map_t: A structure representing the map itself, including terrain types and heights.
      uni_t: A structure representing a universe of maps.
      queue_node_t: A structure representing nodes in a queue.
      Various other data structures for storing and manipulating map data.

Functions:

      initializeUniverse: Initializes a universe structure.
      dijkstra_path: Performs Dijkstra's algorithm to find a path on the map.
      build_paths: Builds paths on the map using Dijkstra's algorithm.
      smooth_height: Smoothes the height map of the terrain.
      randGen: Generates a random number within a given bound.
      possibility: Computes a probability value based on the current position.
      find_building_location: Finds a suitable location for a building on the map.
      place_pokemart: Places a Pok√©mon Mart on the map based on probability.
      place_center: Places a center on the map based on probability.
      border_type: Chooses a terrain type for a border cell based on neighboring cells.
      map_terrain: Generates the terrain of the map.
      place_boulders: Places boulders on the map.
      place_trees: Places trees on the map.
      new_map: Generates a new map with terrain, paths, buildings, etc.

Constants:

      Various constants such as map dimensions, minimum tree and boulder counts, probabilities, and Gaussian smoothing values.
