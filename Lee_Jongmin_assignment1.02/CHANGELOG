Sep. 14 Reviewed all of professor's code and tried to understand. Set blueprint which part should I work and change.

sep. 15 I realized I need first neeed function that generates universe not just one map. So I worked on that first.
        Then moved onto travel function that allowes us to move each map.

sep. 16 added function that no longer exit on end of the universe. 
        added possibility of spawn that goes down when you go further from center. 
        Fixed small bugs that not allowed me to compile.
        after fixed bugs now it's not able to run. segment fault error popped up so I worked on that part to fix
        put several break points by using gdb but don't know where it's making segmentation fault error.

sep. 17 continued to work on segmentation fault error but not much progress changed.
        I found out that when runing main function at line 907 "print_map(u.universe[u.curY][u.curX]);"
        it goes to line 750 which is actual print_map function and then it terminated. It was saying "Program terminated with signal SIGSEGV, Segmentation fault."
        I worked whole day to find where bug is happening and found it but don't know what should I do next since segmentation fault error is quite broad and it's time to submit my work.
