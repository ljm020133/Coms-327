For this assignment, I extended the professor's code from version 1.06 and implemented the following features

Pokémon Spawning Mechanism:
Added a 10% chance of spawning a Pokémon each time the player character enters a grass biome within the game loop.

Random Attribute Generation:
Generated Pokémon ID, gender, shiny status, and level randomly upon spawning.

Level Calculation:
Calculated Pokémon levels based on the distance between the player character and the spawned Pokémon.

Individual Values (IVs):
Assigned random IV values for each stat to enhance the uniqueness of each Pokémon.

Stats Parsing:
Parsed the stats file to obtain base stats for each Pokémon. This process involved a simple iteration through the stat array to find the matching Pokémon ID.

Moveset Retrieval:
Fetched the Pokémon's moveset according to the assignment guidelines, which involved obtaining a vector of possible move IDs and selecting two random moves.

Data Presentation:
Displayed Pokémon information in a user-friendly format to the player.
